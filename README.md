# GPT Sensei

GPT Sensei is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to easily replace selected text with output generated by OpenAI's GPT language model API. To use this extension, you will need to provide your OpenAI API key in `settings.json` as `gptSensei.apiKey`.

## Features

This extension provides a simple way to leverage the power of OpenAI's GPT language model API to generate text based on your selection in a code editor. Simply select the text you would like to replace, invoke the GPT Sensei command, and the extension will replace your selection with text generated by the GPT language model API.

## Configuration

To use GPT Sensei, you will need to provide your OpenAI API key in `settings.json` as `gptSensei.apiKey`. You can also customize the default system message that appears when you invoke the GPT Sensei command. The system message is updated every time the selection changes in an editor, and can contain variables that will be replaced with the current language name and file name.

## Usage

To use GPT Sensei, follow these steps:

1. Highlight the text you would like to replace.
2. Invoke the GPT Sensei command (available on the bottom status bar)
3. The extension will replace your selected text with text generated by the GPT language model API.
